## About Me
Hi there! I’m Md Mahamudul Alam, a passionate Full Stack Developer with a strong focus on the MERN stack. I enjoy turning ideas into clean, efficient, and user-friendly web applications. I’m also motivated by learning and sharing knowledge, and I love helping others grow in their coding journey.
Outside of development, I like exploring new technologies, reading insightful articles, and staying curious about how things work.
